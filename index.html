<h1> UN DATA GRAPHS</h1>
<p>I used data from the UN website (found <a href= "http://data.un.org/">here</a>) to create line graphs which plot statistics for different sets of characteristics for <a href = "https://github.com/mikeizbicki/cmc-csci040/tree/master/hw_04">homework</a>.</p>

<h3>Global literacy over time</h3>
<p>For this graph, I used the <a href = "http://data.un.org/_Docs/SYB/CSV/SYB62_T07_Education.csv">UN CSV file</a> which details education at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels. <br>I chose to focus on education at the primary and secondary levels for all countries and areas to highlight worldwide literacy levels over time.</p>

<h3>Global GDP per capita over time</h3>
<p>For this graph, I used the <a href = "http://data.un.org/_Docs/SYB/CSV/SYB62_T13_201904_GDP%20and%20GDP%20Per%20Capita.csv">UN CSV file</a> which details GDP and GDP per capita. <br>I looked for GDP per capita in US dollars for all countries and areas over a wide span of decades.</p>
